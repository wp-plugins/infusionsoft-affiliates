This plugin allows you to load an Infusionsoft Affiliate's information into your wordpress pages using the [affiliate] shortcode.

== Description ==

After you configure your Infusionsoft Affiliate plugin, you'll be able to sync up your affiliates to your WordPress site and add in affiliate specific merge fields.

Where might you use this?

* Personalized sales pages for your affiliates to use in promoting your product
* Personalized opt-in pages that appear to be written by your affiliate
* Custom webinar sign up forms, one for each affiliate

Use the `[affiliate]` shortcode with a specific field; for example, to get the affiliate's name, use `[affiliate field="AffName"]`.

You can also specify a `default` value like `[affiliate field="AffName" default="your friend"]`.

For fields that are dates, you can specify a [PHP friendly date format](http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php), for example `[affiliate field="_WebinarDate" format="l, f Js" /]`.

Additionally, for date fields, you can move a date forward or backwards in time with the `dateshift` option like `[affiliate field="_WebinarDate" default="3 days before our webinar" format="l, F jS" dateshift=" -3 days" /]`

When using `dateshift`, the value should start with a `+` or a `-` followed by a number and then a unit, for example `- 1 day`, `+90 minutes`, or `+1 year`.

All your custom affiliate fields get pulled down, too, just don't forget to put the underscore in front, i.e. _YourCustomField.
