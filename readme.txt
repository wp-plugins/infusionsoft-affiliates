This plugin allows you to load an Infusionsoft Affiliate's information into your wordpress pages using the [affiliate] shortcode.

== Description ==

After you configure your Infusionsoft Affiliate plugin, you'll be able to sync up your affiliates to your WordPress site and add in affiliate specific merge fields.

Where might you use this?

* Personalized sales pages for your affiliates to use in promoting your product
* Personalized opt-in pages that appear to be written by your affiliate
* Custom webinar sign up forms, one for each affiliate

Use the `[affiliate]` shortcode with a specific field; for example, to get the affiliate's name, use `[affiliate field="AffName"]`.

You can also specify a `default` value like `[affiliate field="AffName" default="your friend"]`.

For fields that are dates, you can specify a [PHP friendly date format](http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php), for example `[affiliate field="_WebinarDate" format="l, f Js" /]`.

Additionally, for date fields, you can move a date forward or backwards in time with the `dateshift` option like `[affiliate field="_WebinarDate" default="3 days before our webinar" format="l, F jS" dateshift=" -3 days" /]`

When using `dateshift`, the value should start with a `+` or a `-` followed by a number and then a unit, for example `- 1 day`, `+90 minutes`, or `+1 year`.

If you are returning any HTML code, for example a tracking pixel, an image tag, rich HTML, etc... you may want to specify `htmldecode=1` to prevent WordPress from escaping your HTML.

All your custom affiliate fields get pulled down, too, just don't forget to put the underscore in front, i.e. _YourCustomField.

== Changelog ==

= Version 2.1 =
* 2/13/2013: Don't update the cache if we didn't get a good download from Infusionsoft (i.e. Infusionsoft API failed or timed out)
* 2/14/2013: Allow for manual syncing

= Version 2.0.2 =
* 2/6/2013: Strip off the query string when an affiliate code is on the root URL with no trailing slash, i.e. http://site.com/affiliatecode?querystring

= Version 2.0.0 =
* 7/3/2012: Moved to 2.0.0 to avoid a prior versioning error (1.8 -> 1.81 -> 1.9)

= Version 1.9 =
* 7/2/2012: Added the ability to disable the plugin on a page by page basis. This way, when cloning a page, the previous page won't be set as the redirect

= Version 1.8 =
* 2/22/2012: Added support for htmldecode to prevent WordPress from escaping HTML when you actually want HTML.

= Version 1.7 =
* 1/28/2012: Added support for registering the plugin. Made redirects temporary redirects. Pages that do not redirect now don't redirect to themselves losing query paramters.

= Version 1.5 =
* 11/22/2011: If a URL is a valid page, don't check for the affiliate in the root of the URL. This prevents affiliates from hijacking pages on your site by picking affiliate codes that match the URLs of pages on your site.

* 10/12/2011: Changed version number to a stable number since... it's stable :)
* 10/12/2011: If an invalid code is specified and a valid code is required, the default page will now be shown. Previously, invalid codes worked

= Version 0.6 =

* 7/12/2011: Root URL affiliate code detection mildly operational
* 7/12/2011: Options for where to look for the affiliate code have been revised so multiple options can be selected

= Version 0.4 =
* 7/11/2011: Default pages are now supported for when an affiliate code is found, but no path is specified, or when an affiliate code is simply not found.

= Version 0.3 =
